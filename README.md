📱 Campus Guide App
A Jetpack Compose practical lab that builds a simple campus exploration app for new students.
The app demonstrates menus, state management, callbacks, images, cards, scrolling layouts, and Compose UI structure.

🎯 Overview
This app helps a new student explore key areas of campus.
The main menu presents five choices:

Library

Computing Labs

Cafeteria

Sports Centre

Student Support

Each choice opens a dedicated content screen with an image, description, and useful information.

🧩 Features
🏠 Main Menu
Displays heading Campus Guide

Includes a short introduction

Shows all five menu choices

Each choice opens its corresponding screen

Uses state + callbacks to manage screen selection

📄 Content Screens
Each screen includes:

Correct title

Relevant image (from drawable-nodpi)

Short description

At least one Card showing useful info (opening hours, facilities, contact details, etc.)

A Back button returning to the menu

Consistent padding, spacing, and theme colours

A Row for horizontal information

Scrollable content for smaller screens

🎨 Layout & Appearance
Consistent padding (e.g., 24.dp)

Material 3 typography and colours

Images sized with fillMaxWidth() and fixed height

Cards styled using CardDefaults and RoundedCornerShape

Scrollable content using verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())

Content stays clear of system bars using consumeWindowInsets(innerPadding)

🖼️ Images
Images are stored in:

Code
app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/
Displayed using:

kotlin
Image(
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.campus_library),
    contentDescription = "Campus library",
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .height(180.dp),
    contentScale = ContentScale.Crop
)
🗂️ Cards
Example card used in content screens:

kotlin
Card(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
    shape = RoundedCornerShape(16.dp),
    colors = CardDefaults.cardColors(
        containerColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceVariant,
        contentColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant
    )
) {
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp),
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp)
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Facilities",
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium
        )
        Text("Study spaces, computers and book loans")
    }
}
🔄 Screen Selection Logic
The app uses a single state variable to track the selected screen.
Example:

null → menu

"library" → Library screen

"cafeteria" → Cafeteria screen

etc.

Clicking a menu item updates the state.
Clicking Back resets the state to null.

🧪 Testing Checklist
✔ Open all five screens
✔ Test Back buttons
✔ Test Android system Back
✔ Test large font sizes
✔ Test light/dark theme
✔ Ensure images have meaningful descriptions
✔ Ensure menu cards scroll on small screens
✔ Test scrolling on small devices
✔ Keep all Kotlin files
✔ Provide screenshots of menu + two content screens
✔ Explain one full sequence: click → callback → state change → updated screen
✔ Explain one image choice and one layout choice
